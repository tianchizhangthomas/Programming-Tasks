# Programming Tasks

In these tasks, I deploy a postgresql service on my local computer (localhost) and it's prone to cause problems for whole system. It is more recommended to deploy a database service on Docker to avoid influence on the system.

## Task 1 Word Search

Firstly, run "create_table_and_insert_for_word_search.py" to create a table in local database and insert the desired board matrix into it. Then, run "word_search.py" to see results.

## Task 2 Crawl Issue Report

Firstly, run "create_table_for_issue_reports.py" to create a table in the database to store issue reports' information. Then, run "crawl_issue_report.py" to crawl one specific issue report and insert crawled information into the created table for future uses.
